## Business Activities

* **What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?**: Emulate Inc. is focused on addressing the inefficiencies of traditional preclinical drug testing methods. Animal models and 2D cell cultures often fail to accurately represent the complexity of human biology, resulting in a high failure rate for clinical trials. The company’s organ-on-a-chip technology offers a more reliable, human-relevant model for testing drug efficacy and toxicity.

* **Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**: Emulate’s intended customers include pharmaceutical companies, biotech firms, academic researchers, and regulatory agencies. These customers use Emulate’s organ-on-a-chip technology to improve drug discovery and test human biology in a more realistic environment. The organ-on-a-chip market is expected to grow significantly, reaching an estimated $1.15 billion by 2029, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30.94%.

* **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**: Emulate’s unfair advantage lies in its ability to replicate physiological functions such as breathing and digestion with high precision. This level of accuracy allows for better predictions of how drugs will affect human organs. Emulate’s partnerships with the FDA for regulatory drug safety evaluations and its ability to scale both research and commercial operations globally further differentiate it from competitors.

* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing—you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)**: Emulate uses **microfluidic technology** to create organ-on-a-chip models. Their **Human Emulation System®** automates and controls the dynamic environment within the chips, simulating physiological conditions like blood flow. Emulate has integrated **AI and machine learning** into their data analysis platforms, allowing for the real-time analysis of data from Organ-Chip experiments, improving the predictability of drug efficacy and toxicity.
